1. Bubble Sort

  A version in English
2. Quick Sort 

  The main oprandi of quicksort is divide and conquer. Quicksort tends to sort things based on whether they are larger or smaller than a specific pivot value. In our case. The pivot value is alway at the front. (For simplicities sake.
  
  It divides and conquers leftmost.
  We begin by incrementing leftmark until we locate a value that is greater than the pivot value. We then decrement rightmark until we find a value that is less than the pivot value. At this point we have discovered two items that are out of place with respect to the eventual split point. Then, we can exchange these two items and then repeat the process again.

  Ensure the the Lefrmost value that has crossed before it start the whole thing above again. But ensure the right index vgalue to the last iteration before the leftmost value

  Then ensure that once it goes all the way left, it goes one right and then does the two pargraphs against by diving at the split point. The quick sort can be invoked recursively on the two halves.

3. Merge Sort

    Its a recursive sort, and like QuickSort it has the operandi of divide and conquer. It keeps on splitting and rearrangering
